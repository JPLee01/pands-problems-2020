#Please be advised that for Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 I set up individual repositories and used them to work on the tasks. The reason I done this was to get used to setting up repositories and pushing/commiting my work on the command drive. 

#It was only on 16 Feb from watching the video about the Problem Sheet that I started copying the Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 to this repository to ensure all the Weekly Tasks were in one repository as per the instructions.

#Since the original commitment of Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 to thier individual repositories I have went back and added comments/tidied up the code.
