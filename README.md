Programming and Scripting: Pands Problems Project 2020

This repository details my research  of the Pands Problems Project for Programming and Scripting 2020.

Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin

The Project instructions can be found at: https://github.com/JPLee01/pands-problems-2020/blob/master/Problems%20Instructions.pdf

# Please Note
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Please be advised that for Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 I set up individual repositories and used them to work on the tasks. The reason I done this was to get used to setting up repositories and pushing/commiting my work on the command drive. 

* It was only on 16 Feb from watching the video about the Problem Sheet that I started copying the Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 to this repository to ensure all the Weekly Tasks were in one repository as per the instructions.

* Since the original commitment of Weekly Tasks Week 2 to 5 to thier individual repositories I have went back and added comments/tidied up the code.

* Week Two Weekly Task, originally completed on 26 Jan but to a different repository
URL of other repository: https://github.com/JPLee01/GMIT-College-Work

* Week Three Weekly Task, originally completed on 02 Feb but to a different repository
URL of other repository: https://github.com/JPLee01/Variables

* Week Four Weekly Task, originally completed on 08 Feb but to a different repository
URL of other repository: https://github.com/JPLee01/Week4

* Week Five Weekly Task, originally completed on 16 Feb but to a different repository
URL of other repository: https://github.com/JPLee01/Week-5

* Please also be advised that since the commit on 16 February where the Weekly tasks for Week 2-5 were added to the pands-problems-2020 respiratory I have no longer used/committed to the respiratories listed above.
